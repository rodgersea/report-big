# report-big

Report-big is a report writing application geared for a specific lead based paint report.

On the home page, there is a download button that delivers a directory to the user with the typical documents produced by a home lead inspection.

After the user downloads the directory, they should submit the folder to the document upload section.

When the user clicks the button "upload", the report application will parse through the documents uploaded and deliver a directory containing the final report along with the individual documents before being concatenated into the long version of the report pdf.
